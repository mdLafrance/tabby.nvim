								 *tabby-about*
1. ABOUT 

Tabby brings ide-like tabs to neovim. Typically, in a visual editor, you 
have panes open each with their own tabs, as well as side content like file
explorers or debuggers. Vim has a different concept of tabs, in which one tab
contains the entire screen worth of windows (including any side content which
are themselves just windows into special buffers).

Tabby lets you open virtual tab groups on top of your windows themselves, so
you can keep your side content open while flipping between buffers. You can even
have two windows with different tab groups open side by side (or as many as you want).

Tab groups created by tabby also support some features you might be used to 
from other visual editors, like mouse support, and clickable close 
functionality.

==============================================================================
								 *tabby-usage*
2. USAGE 

Tabby operates on the concept of "tab groups". A window can be marked as a 
tab group, and then tabs can be opened on that window. You'll know that a
window is a tab group when you can see the tab bar displayed. 

Interaction with tabby is exposed with a collection of user commands detailed
below in |tabby-commands|. See |tabby-tips-and-tricks| for some suggested
workflows and keybinds.

Behind the scenes, tabby is associating a small data structure with that
window id, and swapping out the visible buffer on that window based on your commands.

If you are looking to implement more advanced functionality, the api is well
documented in the core module.

							  *tabby-requirements*
3. REQUIREMENTS

- Neovim 0.8 or higher is required.

- Tabby uses the |winbar| to display tab group information. Therefore, it is
incompatible with any plugins that also want to use the |winbar|.

- Tabby depends on the following plugins:
  1. |telescope.nvim|
  2. |nvim-web-devicons|

  Ensure that these plugins are installed with your plugin manager of choice.

  NOTE: If you disable icons in the tab bar, then you do not need 
  `nvim-web-devicons`. See |tabby-configuration-options|.

==============================================================================
							      *tabby-commands*
3. COMMANDS

Tabby exposes the following user commands:


*:TabbyHelp*
    
    Opens the tabby help file. Exactly the same as running `:help tabby-nvim`.


*:TabbyNewTab*

    Opens a telescope picker to browse for a file to open as a new tab.
    If the current window isn't a tab group, it is converted into one.

    If the current window is not writable, then a new window is opened with a tab 
    group.


*:TabbyCloseTab*

    Closes the current tab in the current tab group.


*:TabbyCloseOtherTabs*

    Closes all tabs except the current one on the current tab group.


*:TabbyConvertToTabGroup*

    Converts the current window into a tab group with the current buffer set
    as the first tab.


*:TabbyNextTab

    Cycle to the next tab in the current tab group.


*:TabbyPreviousTab*

    Cycle to the previous tab in the current tab group.


*:TabbySetTab* {index}

    Set the current tab in the current tab group to the tab at the given index.

    Arguments:
	{index} The index of the tab to switch to. 1-indexed like lua.


*:TabbyDetach* {direction}

    "Detaches" the current tab into a new window, performing a split in the
    specified direction.

    Arguments:
	{direction} The direction to split the tab group into. Valid values are
	left, right, above, and below - the same as vim's |:split|.

    Examples:
    >
	:TabbyDetach right


*:TabbyMerge* {direction}

    "Merges" the current tab or tab group into the closest window or tabgroup
    in the given direction. If the target window is not a tab group, it is
    first converted into one.

    Arguments:
	{direction} The direction to merge in. Valid values are "up", "down",
	"left", "right".

    Examples:
    >
	:TabbyMerge right


*:TabbyShowTabs*

    Prints information about all currently registered tab groups. For
    debugging purposes.

==============================================================================
							 *tabby-configuration*
5. CONFIGURATION

Tabby must be initialized at startup by calling the *tabby-setup()* function. 

At what point you call the setup function depends on your neovim plugin 
manager of choice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
						    *tabby-configuration-options*
5.1 OPTIONS

`setup()` accepts a table with the following options:
>
    require("tabby").setup({
	remove_tab_group_if_only_tab = true,
	show_icon_in_tab_bar = true,
	show_close_all_button_in_tab_bar = true,
	debug = false,
	suppress_notifications = false,
    })
<


`remove_tab_group_if_only_tab` (default: true)

    If true, then when a tab becomes the only tab in the group, the tab
    group is removed (the buffer stays open).


`show_icon_in_tab_bar` (default: true)

   If true, an icon for the current filetype is shown in the tab bar. 


`show_close_all_button_in_tab_bar` (default: true)

    If true, a button is shown in the tab bar which closes all tabs.


`debug` (default: false)

    If true, then enables debug logging.


`suppress_notifications` (default: false)

    If true, then no notifications are shown when a tab is closed.
    Notifications are triggered to warn the user of unsupported behavior.

						    *tabby-configuration-lazy*
5.2 LAZY

If using Lazy.nvim, the following snippet is enough to enable Tabby:
>
    return {
	"mdlafrance/tabby-nvim",
	opts = {
	    -- options
	}
    }
<
or
>
    return {
	"mdlafrance/tabby-nvim",
	config = function()
	    require("tabby").setup({
		-- options
	    })
	end
    }

It's important to either define a *config()* function which calls Tabby's
setup function, or to provide opts so that lazy will call the setup function
itself.

6. TIPS AND TRICKS

Defining some keymaps can be usefule for quickly managing tabs. For example:
>
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>nt", ":TabbyNewTab<CR>", {})
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>cl", ":TabbyCloseTab<CR>", {})

    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>[", ":TabbyPreviousTab<CR>", {})
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>]", ":TabbyNextTab<CR>", {})

    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>tdr", ":TabbyDetach right<CR>", {})
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>tdd", ":TabbyDetach below<CR>", {})

    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>tmr", ":TabbyMerge right<CR>", {})
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>tml", ":TabbyMerge left<CR>", {})
