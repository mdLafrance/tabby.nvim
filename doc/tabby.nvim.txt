								 *tabby.about*
1. ABOUT 

Tabby brings ide-like tabs to neovim. Typically, in a visual editor, you 
have panes open each with their own tabs, as well as side content like file
explorers or debuggers. Vim has a different concept of tabs, in which one tab
contains the entire screen worth of windows (including any side content which
are themselves just windows into special buffers).

Tabby lets you open virtual tab groups on top of your windows themselves, so
you can keep your side content open while flipping between tabs. You can even
have two windows with tab groups open side by side (or as many as you want).

Tab groups created by tabby also support some features you might be used to 
from other visual editors, like mouse support, and clickable close 
functionality.

==============================================================================
								 *tabby.usage*
2. USAGE 

Tabby operates on the concept of "tab groups". A window can be marked as a 
tab group, and then tabs can be opened on that window. 

Behind the scenes, tabby is associating a small data structure with that
window id, and swaps out the buffer on that window based on your commands.

Interaction with tabby is exposed with a collection of user commands detailed
below in |tabby.commands|, which should cover almost all use cases. If you 
are looking to implement more advanced functionality, the api is well
documented in the core module.


==============================================================================
							  *tabby.requirements*
3. REQUIREMENTS

- Neovim 0.8 or higher is required.

- Tabby uses the |winbar| to display tab group information. Therefore, it is
incompatible with any plugins that also want to use the |winbar|.

- Tabby depends on the following plugins:
  1. |telescope.nvim|
  2. |nvim-web-devicons|

  See the |tabby.configuration| section for examples on how to configure these plugins.


==============================================================================
							      *tabby.commands*
3. COMMANDS


*:TabbyHelp*
    
    Opens the tabby help file. Exactly the same as running `:help tabby.nvim`.


*:TabbyNewTab*

    Opens a telescope picker to browse for a file to open as a new tab.
    If the current window isn't a tab group, it is first converted into one.

    If the current window is not writable (for example some kind of utility
    buffer), then a new window is opened as a tab group.


*:TabbyCloseTab*

    Closes the current tab in the current tab group.


*:TabbyConvertToTabGroup*

    Converts the current window into a tab group with the current buffer set
    as the first tab.


*:TabbyNextTab

    Cycle to the next tab in the current tab group.


*:TabbyPreviousTab*

    Cycle to the previous tab in the current tab group.


*:TabbySetTab* {index}

    Set the current tab in the current tab group to the tab at the given index.

    Arguments:
	{index} The index of the tab to switch to. 1-indexed like lua.


*:TabbyDetach* {direction}

    "Detaches" the current tab into a new window, performing a split in the
    specified direction.

    Arguments:
	{direction} The direction to split the tab group into. Valid values are
	left, right, above, and below - the same as vim's |:split|.

    Examples:
    >
	:TabbyDetach right


*:TabbyShowTabs*

    Prints information about all currently registered tab groups. For
    debugging purposes.
